# ðŸ”¥ Express Firestarter ðŸ”¥

This boilerplate app, based on the awesome Express Generator, comes bundled with some extra useful goodies:

- MongoDB through Mongoose
- Realtime through Socket.IO
- Queueing through Kue (/w Redis)
- Vue through .vue components
- Hot Module Replacement through magic
- Buildscript through Makefile

## Reasoning

The boilerplate code you get when you run the [express generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html) is absolute great. However, it's far from complete.

I usually find myself adding abilities to use databases, realtime-ness, queueing and adding some sort of build tool. Rather than doing this every time I want to tinker on a new project and get lost, this boilerplate should be a nice starting point.

## Roadmap

There's no roadmap as such. I'll try to keep the libraries up to date, and will add a feature when I find myself using it often enough.
